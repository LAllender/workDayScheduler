# workDayScheduler
Work Day Scheduler is a daily task time blocking app that was developed using using modified starter code.
When the app is opened the current date is displayed at the top of the calendar.
One hour time blocks are set to cover standard business hours 9am till 5pm.
Timeblocks are colour coded to indicate past, present or future.
Tasks can be entered on the calendar by clicking on the timeblock. 
The thumbs-up icon can be used to save the task to local memory so it i remains available on screen refresh.
The thumbs-down icon can be used to remove tasks from the calendar.
The deployed application can be accessed via this link: https://lallender.github.io/workDayScheduler/
